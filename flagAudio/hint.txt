As Harry sits alone in the Gryffindor common room, the lively chatter of his friends heading to Hogsmeade echoes in the background.
The warmth of the crackling fireplace contrasts with his disappointment. 
Harry is upset because he can't go to Hogsmeade since the Dursleys, didn't sign his permission form.

Their laughter and playful antics, often accompanied by the smell of sweets and the faint crackle of fireworks, seem to weave through the atmosphere. 
The Weasley brothers have a special surprise for Harry.

Decipher the audio to help Nick in finding the surprise.
